Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

Description
---

In this Git repo, I have created a very simple website that displays two rectangles, two circles, two lines, and two strange-looking polygons, each with its own unique(ly ugly) color scheme. Aside from those basic requirements, I did not attempt to go above and beyond with this, as I am still new to the D3 library along with all of its quirks and idiosyncracies.

Given my relative inexperience with d3.js and Git, this assignment was quite a challenge to complete for me, even given the numerous additional sources used, which are enumerated as follows:

- [d3-polygon plugin](https://d3js.org/d3-polygon)
- [D3 Shapes](https://www.d3indepth.com/shapes/)
- [Building shapes in d3.js](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/shape.html#mysegment)

Technical Achievements
---
Despite the fact I didn't quite get to personally experiment with D3 more in depth, I would say that it didn't go quite as poorly as I'd anticipated, especially given I was primarily running Git commands through the Linux command line and had to use outside knowledge of Git from other courses to make the necessary changes to all relevant files, of which there were several. In addition, I was able to get all of my work displayed on a charmingly minimalistic web app, which I was very pleased with in light of some of the limitations imposed (for example, the fact that the objects made using D3 would only render and display if the script itself was situation within the tag it selected despite seemingly being able to render regardless of placement).

Design Achievements
---
As stated in the previous section, the aesthetic of the site I designed was one which I found to be very minimalistic; that is, there were no distracting elements and the user was in no way bombarded with unnecessary, irrelevant, or outright inappropriate information, all problems all to common in the world of web design. Rather, what the user was looking for was already right in front of them: They sought simple geometric shapes and received as much, all without any middle-men or grueling details. All relevant screenshots are provided in the remainder of the a1-ghd3 folder.
